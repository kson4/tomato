        <h2>Why grow your own tomatoes?</h2>
        <p>
          Many people do not like tomatoes. However, I would argue that many people have not
          had the pleasure of trying a "real" tomato. You see, a tomato that is fully ripe
          would be an absolute nightmare to ship out to your local grocery stores. The slightest
          touch would easily leave an indent and ruin its marketability. A close analogy I can give
          of this would be similar to squeezing a ripe kiwi, or even an avocado.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, farmers would purposefully harvest their tomatoes while they are still green,
          giving them more durability. Like many fruits, tomatoes will still ripen off the vine. 
          By the time the tomatoes reach your local grocery store, they will have ripen just 
          enough to change color, but hardly any further.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, tomatoes that were not given the adequate chance to fully ripen, are significantly
          inferior. They lack the sweetness and flavor that many homegrown tomatoes have.

        <h2>Head over to your local farmer's market</h2>
        <p>
          Once you get there, keep a look out for <strong>heirloom</strong> tomatoes. If you do not 
          have one nearby, my local Sprouts, Trader Joes, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods have them
          as well. One thing that I will have to warn you about is the price. You may find that it
          could often cost two, maybe three, times more expensive than the average tomato
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I would still encourage to try them out. I do not mean to exaggerate but, my life
          was completely changed afterwards. They are now my new found obsession. However, you may
          have noticed that they are still too expensive

        <h2>You can grow them yourself!</h2>
        <p>
          If you were able to get yourself some heirloom tomatoes, you may have noticed that they
          were noticeably sweeter. Were you also able to tell how much softer they were? It would
          be nearly impossible for farmers to be able to ship them out long distances in that
          fragile state.
