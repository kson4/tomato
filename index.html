          <h2>WHY GROW YOUR OWN TOMATOES?</h2>
          <p>
            Many people do not like tomatoes. However, I would argue that many people have not
            had the pleasure of trying a "real" tomato. You see, a tomato that is fully ripe
            would be an absolute nightmare to ship out to your local grocery stores. The slightest
            touch would easily leave an indent and ruin its marketability. A close analogy I can give
            of this would be similar to squeezing a ripe kiwi, or even an avocado.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, farmers would purposefully harvest their tomatoes while they are still green,
            giving them more durability. Like many fruits, tomatoes will still ripen off the vine. 
            By the time the tomatoes reach your local grocery store, they will have ripen just 
            enough to change color, but hardly any further.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, tomatoes that were not given the adequate chance to fully ripen, are significantly
            inferior. They lack the sweetness and flavor that many homegrown tomatoes have.

          <h2>HEAD OVER TO YOUR LOCAL FARMER'S MARKET</h2>
          <p>
            Once you get there, keep a look out for <strong>heirloom</strong> tomatoes. If you do not 
            have one nearby, my local Sprouts, Trader Joes, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods have them
            as well. One thing that I will have to warn you about is the price. You may find that it
            could often cost two, maybe three, times more expensive than the average tomato
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I would still encourage to try them out. I do not mean to exaggerate but, my life
            was completely changed afterwards. They are now my new found obsession. However, you may
            have noticed that they are still too expensive

          <h2>YOU CAN GROW THEM YOURSELF!</h2>
          <p>
            If you were able to get yourself some heirloom tomatoes, you may have noticed that they
            were noticeably sweeter. Were you also able to tell how much softer they were? It would
            be nearly impossible for farmers to be able to ship them out long distances in that
            fragile state.
